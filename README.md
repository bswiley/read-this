#Read-This

## Description
The purpose of this project is to make writing README.md files easier.  I found that I had problems writing README.md files mainly because I always was trying to think about how they would turn out in advance of writing them.  The anxiety made it all the harder to write them.  As such I thought that this application would make it esaier to write them because all I'd have to do was answer a few questions and the README.md would be written based on those questions.  I wouldn't have to spend time thinking so much about how to compose the README.md.  This application solved that problem.  I made it so that all you have to do is answer a few questions and after they are over, it will write the README.md for me. 

## Installation
To use this application, Node.js needs to be installed as well as the dependencies inquireer@8.2.4 and fs.
